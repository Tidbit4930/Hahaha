# Cryptocurrency and Laughter

Oh, cryptocurrency, digital gold,
A tale of innovation, often told.
In bits and bytes, our fortune's cast,
In blockchain's trust, we hope it'll last.

Mining coins, or trading high,
We laugh at gains, to the sky.
In bear and bull, in loss and gain,
In crypto's world, laughter remains.

A chuckle at a meme coin's rise,
At Doge's bark and Shiba's eyes.
From Bitcoin's might to Ether's flame,
We laugh at volatility's wild game.

So hodl on, through ups and downs,
Let laughter drown financial frowns.
In crypto's waves, we ride the tide,
With laughter as our trusted guide.

Blockchain's gift, a digital spark,
In laughter's light, we leave a mark.
Embrace the future, embrace the change,
With laughter, life's never strange.
